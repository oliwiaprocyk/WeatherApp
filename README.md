# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is a fully programmatic application designed to provide comprehensive information about current weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, visibility, humidity, and pressure for any desired city. In addition to its weather functionalities, the app also incorporates an interactive feature that enables users to obtain a fortune by simply tapping a button located conveniently at the bottom of the screen. This delightful addition enhances the user experience, adding an element of surprise and enjoyment.

Furthermore, WeatherApp includes an additional functionality that allows users to access detailed weather forecasts for the next three days: today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. These forecasts provide users with hourly weather information. By tapping the "Details" button, users can explore in-depth information about the weather conditions for each hour of these specific days. This feature enables users to plan their activities with precision, taking into account the weather variations throughout the day.

WeatherApp also offers a seamless user interface with the flexibility to switch between light and dark modes. This allows users to personalize their experience and choose the mode that suits their preferences. Whether it's a bright and vibrant interface or a sleek and elegant dark theme, the app ensures a visually appealing and comfortable usage environment.
